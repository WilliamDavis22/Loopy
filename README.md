#### -- LOOPY SETUP--

Hello! I&#39;m glad that you have made it here, I must admit I rarely ever look a the README file even if the letters are in all-caps. However, it is likely you will find this information very helpful in understanding my horrendous file-management.

1. THIS IS A BETA
  1. At the moment, you are likely here as a result of being connected to me through Bates College or my immediate friend group. This is the product of 2 days with no sleep and keeping track of time with beers and cups of coffee.
  2. I will be releasing an update soon fixing some bugs with the voice-recorder, the &quot;2x Loop&quot; button, and improved functionality with the pitch and reverb sliders.
  3. My most important plan for the future is to collect different sounds-banks and have a list of which type of instrument you want the use the synth on.
2. GETTING STARTED
  1. To download the Pure Data platform, follow this link: [https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data](https://puredata.info/downloads/pure-data)
    1. If you have a Mac, click on the Apple logo highest on the list. This should automatically download the _ **pd-0.50-2.mac.tar.gz** _file on your computer. Double-click it and the app should be automatically installed in your downloads.
    2. Move this to your applications folder.
  2. You are seeing this because you have likely unzipped the file I sent to you. In the Loopy folder, there should be a file called _ **Loopy-02** __ **.pd** _. Open this file and you should see the interface. I am actively working on cleaning up the folder so it&#39;s easier to manage.

1. OPERATING MANUAL

    1. — HEADPHONES ARE ESSENTIAL—
    2. You can set this up by going to the _ **Pd** _button at the top of your screen, going to preferences, audio, and then choosing your input and output devices.

  1. The drum kit is numbers 1-10 on the keyboard (WARNING: It is pretty loud so keep the volume very low)
  2. The piano is set like most MIDI keyboard setups (G=G,H=A,J=B,K=D… etc — it&#39;s pretty intuitive and the buttons help).
  3. If you have a Mac, your computer might want to quickly push some of the piano sample waves to the cloud. If the keys aren&#39;t producing sound, the .wav files are either in the cloud or not in the correct location.
  4. The piano and bass operate on partly the same keys, so when you want a piano, turn the bass down, if you want bass, turn the piano down. You can choose to have a little bit on top of the other, it&#39;s fun to experiment with.
  5. The loopers work pretty much like loopers but the pitch and reverb are there mostly for aesthetics, I&#39;ll get them functional soon.
  6. The voice looper was giving me problems right at the end so I&#39;m going to have to investigate that further. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#39;t.
